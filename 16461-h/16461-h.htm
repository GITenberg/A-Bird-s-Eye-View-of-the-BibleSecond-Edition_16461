<h3><span class="smcap">To First Edition</span></h3>


<p>The Bible is a Lamp to our feet and a light to our pathway. To know it
thoroughly is to be kept from stumbling, and to walk in the light is
fellowship with Him who is the heart of the Book.</p>

<p>The Bible is a Rock; to be familiar with its pages is to be established
in character, in hope and in faith, and while we may sometimes tremble,
the rock is immovable. The Bible is the true water of life. Mr. Moody
used to say that it comes down from on high and rises again in mighty
power to the throne on the principle that water seeks its own level. To
know the Bible is, therefore, to live a heavenly life and to be filled
with all the fullness of the spirit of Christ.</p>

<p>The author of this text book knows his Bible thoroughly and he has the
God-given ability of making it plain to others. What is here presented
he has worked out in the class room and in his own rich Christian
experience. I count it a privilege to write this line of introduction.
The members of the Young People's Societies in the churches, Christian
Associations, Bible study classes and Christian workers generally will
find it most helpful. A busy business man by means of it could think his
way through much of God's Word. It is a timely presentation of a great
subject. I am sure that God will bless it richly to all who attempt to
study it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>SEARCH Series of Bible Study Text Books</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><em>&quot;Be Ye Explorers of the Writings.&quot;</em>&mdash;<span class="smcap">John</span> 5:39</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Teachers of the Scriptures are issuing many valuable aids to Bible
study. This series of text books is based upon the &quot;Search&quot; idea. We
believe this idea is fundamental. It is commended to the student public
for the following reasons:</p>

<p><em>It is the Divine Method.</em></p>

<p>&quot;<em>Seek</em> ye out of the book of Jehovah&quot; is the God-given command in
Isaiah 34:16 &quot;Search ye the Scriptures&quot; is the command of the God-man in
John 5:39. The God who wrote the Book and the God who knows man will
prescribe the best method by which man shall become acquainted with the
Book.</p>

<p><em>It is the Pedagogic Method.</em></p>

<p>&quot;What seest thou?&quot; One basic pedagogic principle is to train the pupil's
physical and mental eyes to see things for himself. The first and
largest gate to knowledge is the <em>eye</em> gate.</p>

<p><em>It is the Scientific Method.</em></p>

<p>The scientist searches for facts. He hunts for facts in the stars, in
the rocks, in the plants, in the animals. From these facts he deduces
principles. &quot;What saith the Scriptures?&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><em>It is the Interesting Method.</em></p>

<p>The search of the hunter, the explorer, the experimenter, the excavator,
the student, is a joyous labor. Every sense is alert There is no
drudgery, no fatigue. The &quot;eureka&quot; stirs a song of gladness. There is
much joy in bearing this testimony: &quot;I have found Micah 6:8, or Isaiah
12, or Jeremiah 45:5, or Philippians 4:19,&quot; etc.</p>

<p>Now this is a Workable Method. The teacher can apply it. Give every
pupil a certain definite Search task. The teacher can adapt it to every
age, and to every degree of Biblical knowledge. This series of text
books will suggest plans of applying this basic method of Bible study in
becoming acquainted with the rich contents of the verses, the chapters,
the books of this most practical Word of God.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>PREFACE TO THE BOOK</h2>


<h5>1. <span class="smcap">The Purpose</span></h5>

<p>This book is designed to be used in Bible Study Classes in churches, in
communities, in academies, in colleges. The author has endeavored to
furnish a text book of outlines and questions that shall unfold the
general contents of the Word of God. Its primary aim is to impart a
swift and comprehensive acquaintanceship with the material of the books
of the Bible.</p>

<h5>2. <span class="smcap">The Character of the Work</span></h5>

<p>It is not an exhaustive study. From its aim it could not be such. Some
of the sixty-six books are passed over in brief space, and some (chiefly
in the prophecies and epistles) are omitted altogether. It is a surface
study. The title so suggests. It does not enter into the deeper things.
It simply aims to lay bare the surface facts. It is expressly designed
to serve as a foundation for later detailed searching of the Word. It is
flexible. The teacher can add or subtract as time or local conditions
demand, and is earnestly exhorted so to do. One book may be omitted and
another added at the teacher's discretion. A part of the questions may
be omitted, or additional ones inserted. The outlines may be enlarged or
diminished or changed to suit the needs of the class according to the
teacher's personal judgment.</p>

<h5>3. <span class="smcap">Requisites For Study</span></h5>

<p>Let each scholar be provided with a cheap tablet, a well-bound blank
book of two hundred pages, a small Bible Dic<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>tionary of recognized
merit, and a copy of the American Revised Version of the Bible.
(Standard Edition of Nelson &amp; Sons, 1901, bourgeois 8vo, is good.) The
teacher should provide for reference, to which the pupils should have
constant access, a copy of the Rand-McNally Bible Atlas, by J.L.
Hurlbut, D.D., a copy of Young's Complete Analytical Concordance, and a
copy of a large and complete Bible Dictionary.</p>

<h5>4. <span class="smcap">Suggestions to Teachers</span></h5>

<p>To secure the best results the following plan, tested by experience, is
suggested: Let the assigned lesson be wrought out and recorded by the
pupil in the cheap tablet. At the next recitation let this recorded
lesson be read and corrected. At the following recitation this lesson
first assigned and corrected is to be recited from memory. So at each
recitation the following will be the general order: (1) The assigning of
the advance lesson. (2) The reading and correction of the lesson
assigned at the previous recitation. (3) The reciting from memory of the
lesson corrected at the previous recitation.</p>

<p>The work as soon as corrected is to be recorded by the scholar in the
blank book according to a simple set of rules. The following rules have
been used with good results:</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Directions for Bible Books</span></h5>

<ol><li>Record each lesson the evening after its correction. (Commit the
work, as you record, for recital.)</li>

<li>Begin each large division at the top of the page.</li>

<li>Capitalize and underline all headings.</li>

<li>Leave a vacant line between small divisions.</li>

<li>Where questions are used, record both questions and answers.</li>

<li><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>The books will be graded substantially as follows:

<ul class="off">
<li>Correctness of record, 35. (Includes spelling and grammar.)</li>

<li>Fullness of record, 35.</li>

<li>Neatness and care, 10.</li>

<li>Mechanical accuracy, 10.</li>

<li>Originality, 10.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>


<p>It would be well to place a printed copy of these rules in the hands of
each student, to be pasted in the front of the blank book. These blank
books should be examined and graded every four or six weeks and should
constitute at least a third of the student's grade. The recording of the
work in the blank books may be omitted in the community or church
classes, at the option of the teacher. But the record of the work by
pencil in a cheap tablet <em>should be insisted upon as absolutely
necessary for the best results</em>. In the academy and college classes the
painstaking record in ink has been found by experience to be a most
valuable portion of the study.</p>

<p>Let the teacher review constantly. Drill the students, singly and
collectively, in the recitation material. Emphasize the avoidance of
mechanical study. Secure as much consecutive reading of the Word as
possible. Feed upon rich truths. Make practical and personal
applications of the Word. &quot;All Scripture is profitable.&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>NOTES ON THE CHART</h4>

<p>1. The sixty-six books are divided into ten groups, according to their
relation to the Kingdom. In this connection the word Kingdom is not used
in any restricted or technical sense. It is used to designate the
Kingdom of God instituted to redeem the race from sin, under whatever
form manifested.</p>

<p>2. Several of the books are not located in their exact places. Esther is
located in Division Six because it is Captivity narrative. The Kings and
Chronicles technically overlap two divisions. Lamentations and Jeremiah
chronologically belong to the preceding division, but are placed among
the books of the Captivity because their wails betoken that event.</p>

<p>3. The books in each division are arranged in chronological order. In
Division Nine the fourteen epistles of Paul are placed first, in the
order of their composition, then the seven general epistles in the order
of their writing.</p>

<p>4. Where the books of a division are separated into two groups by a
dash, those above the dash are historical, those beneath the dash are
biographical, or poetical, or legal, or prophetical, or epistolary.</p>

<p>5. The teacher may exercise his own judgment in requiring the committal
of this chart at the start, or part by part as the study proceeds.</p>

<h4><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>NOTES ON HISTORICAL OUTLINE AND ITS USE</h4>

<p>Most of the books in the first four divisions will be studied with this
outline as a basis. In the pursuance of these lessons the numbers left
vacant in the outline are to be wrought out by the pupils. In recording
the work in the blank book the first page is to be given to the
pictorial device. One of these will be printed in its appropriate place.
Let students prepare the others. Urge the pupils to use originality of
thought and pen in producing them. The aim of the device is to impress
by a simple picture the contents of the book as a whole. Under No. 2 the
kind of literature may be described, as history, law, discourse,
biography, etc. Secure answers to Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 in Bible Dictionary.
As a rule, Nos. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 will be given. Under No. 10 part of the
chapters will be named, and part are to be read and named by the pupils.
After the pupils present the names of these chapters in class, one must
be agreed upon, so that the names will be uniform. When the names of
chapters are given in the outline, require the pupils to glance over the
chapters and verify them. Under No. 13 the foreshadowed facts of Christ
are given, so as to manifest Him as the living center of the Book. Only
the leading ones are selected. The teacher or pupil may add others. For
convenience sake they are classified as follows: (a) Symbol; (b) Type;
(c) Analogy; (d) Prophecy. Though the words symbol and type are not
technically distinct, we have agreed to use the word <em>symbol</em> to
designate an <em>object</em> or <em>animal</em> that prefigures Christ, as &quot;star&quot; or
&quot;lamb,&quot; and the word <em>type</em> to designate a <em>person</em> that prefigures
Christ, as Melchizedek or Moses. We have also agreed to limit the
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>symbols and types to those directly or indirectly mentioned in the New
Testament. By analogy we mean a person who, though widely differing from
Christ in many particulars, bears some one resemblance to Him in quality
or deed. These analogies are not mentioned in the New Testament. The
word <em>prophecy</em> in the outline is confined, then, to <em>facts</em> foretold
regarding Christ. Under No. 15 let the teacher call for five or ten
(suit the number to conditions) items of peculiar interest, touching the
literary form, events, facts, teachings, etc. This topic is in accord
with the first article of the Creed recorded on the opening page of the
book. Under No. 16 let the teacher assign at least one chapter rich in
contents for individual search upon the part of the pupils. Let the
pupils record and number their individual finds. This in accord with the
fifth article of the Creed. The purpose is to cultivate the &quot;seeing eye&quot;
and to develop originality in Bible research.</p>

<p>These questions must needs be few in number. If the time permits, let
the teacher add others. They are designed to be mere surface questions,
to secure acquaintanceship with a few of the great facts. In assigning
the questions on each book of the Bible let the teacher go over them
with the class, seeking their knowledge (or imparting it) as to the
chapters in which the answers may be found. If the class has the time
and desires a more thorough acquaintance with each book, let each member
prepare two &quot;large&quot; questions on each chapter, or upon as many chapters
as they desire. The following questions on Chapter 1 will serve as
examples: (1) Name the seven purposes of the lights. (2) State the
number of times the word God occurs.</p></li>

<li><em>Items of Special Interest:</em>

<ol class="sub">
<li>The symmetry of the paragraphs in the record of the six creative days
in Chapter 1.</li>

<li>God's notice of the human countenance. 4:6.</li>

<li>The first piece of recorded poetry is degenerating, bloody. 4:23, 24.</li>

<li>The word for &quot;rooms,&quot; 6:14, in the margin is &quot;nests&quot;&mdash;a primitive

<p>Under No. 5 fail not to compare length of time covered by different
books. Under No. 7 ask pupils to show the appropriateness. Under No. 9
teacher may require committal of location or not, as is deemed
advisable. Under No. 12 show the truth of these universal lessons
through the march of history. Under No. 13 copy the references, be able
to explain their meaning, and to show the likeness between the symbol,
the type, and Christ. In copying this outline work the pupil may or may
not omit the names of the fourteen topics, according to the teacher's
judgment. For the inspection of friends it would be preferable to have
the words of these topics repeated with each outline, as in Genesis. As
an aid to concert recitation let the teacher place the topics of the

<h3><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>THE PSALMS</h3>

<ol class="RU"><li><em>The Collection and Divisions:</em>

<p>In all probability the book of one hundred and fifty psalms, as it now
stands, was compiled by Ezra about 450 B.C.</p>

<p>They are divided into five books, each closing with a benediction,
evidently added to mark the end of the book. Note the number of psalms
in Books 1 and 2.</p></li>

<li><em>The Purposes:</em>

<ol class="sub"><li>They were originally used as songs in the Jewish Temple Worship.</li>

<li>For centuries after Christ they formed the only Christian Hymnal.</li>

<li>They have comforted and supported the troubled hearts of all
believers in all ages.</li></ol></li>

<li><em>General Characteristics:</em>

<ol class="sub"><li>They are <em>personal</em>.&mdash;Number the first personal pronouns in Psalm 23.
Note the frequent occurrence in others.</li>

<li>They are the expression of <em>heart</em> experiences.&mdash;Note the frequent
use of the words heart and soul. These Hebrew poems are largely the
diaries of the inner life.</li>

<li>They express the <em>intimate relation</em> between God and man.&mdash;Note in
Psalms 23, 103, 139 how many the phrases which contain pronouns and
words referring to both God and man.</li></ol></li>

<li><em>Specific Characteristics:</em>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Select a sentence from any psalm, illustrating each

<h3><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>THE SONG OF SOLOMON</h3>

<ol class="RU"><li><em>Author.</em></li>

<li><em>Names:</em>

<ul class="off"><li>(1) Song of Solomon.</li>

<li>(2) Song of Songs.</li>

<li>(3) Canticles.</li></ul>

<p>Give the meaning of each.</p></li>

<li><em>General Description:</em>

<p>It is probably an allegorical drama. It pictures the love of Solomon to
a princess, typifying, as many believe, the love of Christ to the
Church. Read Ephesians 5 and be prepared to answer questions thereon.
Richard Moulton describes it as containing seven idyllic poems.</p></li>

<li><em>Words of Explanation:</em>

<ol class="sub"><li>Its Oriental tinge must be remembered. In the Occident uncovered
breasts would be an impropriety, but not in the Orient.</li>

<li>The revised version removes some questionable utterances. Compare in
the two versions 1:13 and 5:14.</li>

<li>Were we less sensual we could better appreciate its beauty. The
beautiful in art is greatly lost by the impurity of our fleshly nature.
So the beautiful in this poem.</li>

<li>It is a poem, hence the author uses the poetic license.</li>

<li>The poem needs a division into its parts, and a naming of parts,
places and speakers, for a clearer understanding. Students of the poem
have made this division. The following is a sample:

<ol class="sub"><li>Antechamber of Palace.&mdash;Bride and Ladies.&mdash;Welcome to Home.&mdash;1:2 to
1:8.</li>

<ol><li>Name five portions of Scripture that are repeated.</li>

<li>Four reasons why the Lord's life is recorded four times:

<ul class="off"><li>(1) To emphasize its importance.</li>

<li>(2) To multiply the testimony to His life in the flesh.</li>

<li>(3) To present the different aspects of His character.</li>

<li>(4) To reach different classes of people.</li></ul></li></ol>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The Gospels were originally sermons, and the authors
preachers. They are not designed as biographies. One has described them
as &quot;memoirs of a life, to teach a religion.&quot; Hence one need not expect
chronological order. Their purpose is not to record the life of Christ,
but to win a lost world to the Savior.</p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
